# Wombatish Theme

Wombatish theme is ported from the Wombatish TextMate/Sublime theme which is in turn based on original Wombat for Vim.  


Theme is mainly optimized for [HTML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-saling/blobs/master/vscode/wombatish/html.png), [JS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-saling/blobs/master/vscode/wombatish/js.png), [CSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-saling/blobs/master/vscode/wombatish/css.png) and [SCSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-saling/blobs/master/vscode/wombatish/sass.png) but works with JAVA, PHP, Ruby, Python and Bash.
